            The Openmesh Protocol and Openmesh Network are not private
            companies. The Openmesh Expansion Program is the first-ever
            community funding initiative approved by OpenmeshDAO in August to
            support the Openmesh roadmap and the expansion of Openmesh&apos;s
            infrastructure from Q3 2024 to Q4 2025.

            To date, Openmesh has never raised any funds from external sources.
            No VCs, no private sales, no node sales, and no ICOs. Since late
            2020, Openmesh has spent approximately $8.78 million in R&D,
            bootstrapped by the early founders.

            We all admire the core principles of Web3 â€” decentralization,
            fairness, transparency, and freedom. However, more than 82% of
            critical Web3 infrastructure such as dApps, Web3 services, Web3
            frontends, databases, APIs, and even validator nodes are hosted in
            centralized clouds like AWS/GCP.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            When Ethereum moved from PoW to PoS, it introduced a new problem.
            More than 70% of Ethereum nodes are running on AWS & GCP today. The
            largest, most active RPC providers in the entire Web3 space, not
            just Ethereum, are centralized and privately owned. Their tech is
            proprietary.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Most of the L1s/L2a and DLTs are backed and managed by foundations.
            Having a private company or a non-profit foundation means having
            shareholders and directors. Having a bank account means having
            account holders and signatories. Having agreements between teams
            with the foundation means people and accountabilities are tied to a
            country or state. If governments or regulators want to shut down a
            Web3 service, they simply tell AWS or Google to shut it down.
          </Text>

            We envision a world where trust is built into the design, not into
            brands or people who are running it. Instead of relying on a small
            group of people, we should have technologies that are immutable by
            design and verified by widely distributed independent verifiers.

                Building a Decentralized Cloud + Data + Oracle Network for the

                <br />
                Openmesh Protocol combines the best features of L1 network
                programmability and security, the flexibility and scalability of
                public cloud solutions like AWS, and immutable data and
                decentralized oracles like Chainlink into a single solution.

                OpenmeshP2P: A platform that allows anyone to rent their unused
                computers to someone anywhere in the world. Openmesh connects
                providers (individual computer owners, businesses, data centers,
                and even public cloud providers) to customers, enabling
                startups, L1/L2 chains, and DAOs to compare and choose from
                thousands of providers instead of one, saving up to 90% on their
                infrastructure costs.
                <br />
                <br />
                The Openmesh Core is secured by Openmesh Core and a consensus
                algorithm. The network smart contracts and Openmesh PoS ensure
                security, privacy, and accountability, similar to the Bitcoin
                network.

          <Text>
            Selected sponsors will meet the Openmesh team to discuss the roadmap
            and understand how their contributions will accelerate
            Openmesh&apos;s expansion. This event will also serve as an
            opportunity for in-depth discussions and clarifications regarding
            the sponsorship process.

            Sponsors will receive Cloud Credits, redeemable as Xnodes, which can
            be utilized to support the Decentralized Cloud Initiative (DCI) and
            other Openmesh services, or converted into sOPEN or OPEN tokens. As
            early backers, sponsors may also receive governance tokens as a
            token of appreciation for their support. These tokens will enable
            sponsors to contribute to the network&apos;s governance, particularly in
            roles such as network operators, Verified Contributors, and Openmesh
            Verified Resource Providers.

            DAO Culture and Legal Considerations:
            <ListItem>
              Exploring DAO Culture: Openmesh operates within the evolving
              framework of a DAO, a structure that is relatively new and still
              in experimental phases. Openmesh is taking proactive steps to
              address legal and tax-related concerns, particularly for sponsors
              based in Australia. A specialized tax law firm in Sydney will
              manage all necessary reporting and filings, ensuring compliance
              without requiring the establishment of a formal company, given
              that Openmesh is structured as a Decentralized Autonomous
              Organization (DAO). (DAO structures are very common practice in
              the Web3 industry)
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              To ensure the integrity and longevity of Openmesh and following
              the pure decentralization philosophy, we refuse to establish a
              legal entity where we may have centralized chokepoints.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The legal status of DAOs in Australia and the US is unclear,
              creating certain ambiguities. Openmesh is navigating this emerging
              space with a focus on innovation and ethical practices, while also
              trying to navigate and respect the law of the land.

          <Text>
            By participating in or contributing to the Openmesh initiative,
            including but not limited to providing sponsorship, donations, or
            any form of support, all participants, contributors, and sponsors
            expressly agree to waive any and all claims of liability against
            Openmesh, its brand, its contributors, and any associated
            individuals or entities.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Furthermore, all participants, contributors, and sponsors agree to
            indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Openmesh, its affiliates,
            employees, agents, and representatives from and against any and all
            claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including
            reasonable attorneys&apos; fees) arising out of or related to their
            participation or contributions to Openmesh.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            This waiver is comprehensive and covers all forms of potential
            liability, ensuring that Openmesh and its associated parties are
            fully protected from any legal or financial consequences related to
            the initiative.
