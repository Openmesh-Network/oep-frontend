            </strong>

          <Title>Decentralization Compromised</Title>
          <Text>
            A critical issue in Web3 is the growing dependence of blockchain
            nodes being hosted on centralized Web2 infrastructure.{" "}
          </Text>
          <Text>
            More than 80% of critical Web3 infrastructure—including validator
            nodes, dApps, frontends, databases, and APIs—relies on centralized
            cloud platforms like AWS and Google Cloud. Ethereum&apos;s
            transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS)
            exacerbated this centralization, with more than 70% of Ethereum
            nodes now relying on these same centralized cloud providers.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            This reliance undermines decentralization both operationally and
            technically, introducing avoidable vulnerabilities. If governments
            or regulatory authorities seek to target and terminate any Web3
            service, they can direct cloud service providers, such as AWS or
            Google, to cease providing their services to these nodes. Similarly,
            a simple change in a cloud provider&apos;s Terms of Service could
            disrupt or even block the ability of nodes to operate.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            The impact on blockchains and the dApps they support is substantial,
            calling for a solution that can restore true decentralization and
            resilience in Web3 infrastructure.
          </Text>
          <Title>Openmesh&apos;s Solution</Title>
          <Text>
            Openmesh is building a fully decentralized cloud, data, and oracle
            network that eliminates the need for middlemen and centralized
            servers. By providing decentralized, permissionless cloud
            infrastructure, Openmesh ensures that blockchain nodes, Web3, and
            even Web2 applications can operate seamlessly without the threat of
            regulatory overreach or centralized control. With Openmesh, trust is
            embedded in the system itself, validated by a decentralized network
            of independent, anonymous validators, ensuring immutability and
            security by design.
          </Text>
          <Title>Principles and Governance</Title>
          <Text>
            Openmesh is built on the core principles of Web3: decentralization,
            transparency, immutability, and security, ensuring sovereignty for
            all users. These values are deeply embedded in Openmesh&apos;s
            design and architecture, making it a truly decentralized solution.{" "}
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Openmesh operates under a Decentralized Autonomous Organization
            (DAO), not as a private company. This governance model allows for
            community-driven decision-making and ensures that no single entity
            has control over the network. Since its inception in late 2020,
            Openmesh has invested approximately $8.78 million in research and
            development, entirely bootstrapped by its early founders without any
            external funds, venture capital, private sales, or ICOs. This
            self-sustained approach demonstrates our commitment to building a
            resilient and independent network. The DAO structure not only aligns
            with our decentralization goals but also fosters a collaborative
            environment where all stakeholders have a voice in shaping the
            future of Openmesh.

          <Title>Community-Driven Growth</Title>
          <Text>
            The Openmesh Expansion Program (OEP) is a community-funded

            Openmesh roadmap and expand its infrastructure from Q3 2024 through

                providers (individual computer owners, businesses, data centers,
                and even public cloud providers) to customers, enabling
                startups, L1/L2 chains, and DAOs to compare and choose from
                thousands of providers instead of one, saving up to 90% on their

            Selected sponsors will meet the Openmesh team to discuss the roadmap
            and understand how their contributions will accelerate
            Openmesh&apos;s expansion. This event will also serve as an
            opportunity for in-depth discussions and clarifications regarding
            the sponsorship process.

            Sponsors will receive Cloud Credits, redeemable as Xnodes, which can
            be utilized to support the Decentralized Cloud Initiative (DCI) and
            other Openmesh services, or converted into sOPEN or OPEN tokens. As
            early backers, sponsors may also receive governance tokens as a
            token of appreciation for their support. These tokens will enable
            sponsors to contribute to the network&apos;s governance,
            particularly in roles such as network operators, Verified
            Contributors, and Openmesh Verified Resource Providers.

            DAO Culture and Legal Considerations:
            <ListItem>
              Exploring DAO Culture: Openmesh operates within the evolving
              framework of a DAO, a structure that is relatively new and still
              in experimental phases. Openmesh is taking proactive steps to
              address legal and tax-related concerns, particularly for sponsors
              based in Australia. A specialized tax law firm in Sydney will
              manage all necessary reporting and filings, ensuring compliance
              without requiring the establishment of a formal company, given
              that Openmesh is structured as a Decentralized Autonomous
              Organization (DAO). (DAO structures are very common practice in
              the Web3 industry)
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              To ensure the integrity and longevity of Openmesh and following
              the pure decentralization philosophy, we refuse to establish a
              legal entity where we may have centralized chokepoints.
            </ListItem>
            <ListItem>
              The legal status of DAOs in Australia and the US is unclear,
              creating certain ambiguities. Openmesh is navigating this emerging
              space with a focus on innovation and ethical practices, while also
              trying to navigate and respect the law of the land.

          <Subtitle>Liability and Risk Management</Subtitle>
          <Text>
            By participating in or contributing to the Openmesh initiative,
            including but not limited to providing sponsorship, donations, or
            any form of support, all participants, contributors, and sponsors
            expressly agree to waive any and all claims of liability against
            Openmesh, its brand, its contributors, and any associated
            individuals or entities.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            Furthermore, all participants, contributors, and sponsors agree to
            indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Openmesh, its affiliates,
            employees, agents, and representatives from and against any and all
            claims, liabilities, damages, losses, or expenses (including
            reasonable attorneys&apos; fees) arising out of or related to their
            participation or contributions to Openmesh.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            This waiver is comprehensive and covers all forms of potential
            liability, ensuring that Openmesh and its associated parties are
            fully protected from any legal or financial consequences related to
            the initiative.
          </Text>
          <Subtitle>Transparency and Ethical Commitment</Subtitle>
          <Text>
            Openmesh is committed to transparency and ethical operations. All
            activities related to the Openmesh Expansion Program will be
            conducted with the highest standards of integrity, ensuring that all
            parties involved are fully informed and protected.
